        <h1>**story idea**</h1>

        <h2>setup</h2>
        
        pan shots from a forest to an old house, looking a lil creepy through different parts of the house till we get to the room with the less likely protgonist.
        its dark but you can make out the outline of a person lay on a crappy looking matress in the middle of the room and what looks like a bullet hole in the wall
        letting in a small funnel of light that somehow illuminates nothing 

        The protagoists eyes open to the darkness for the 3rd day 

        " view intermitently from the protagonists eyes and a few points in the room during the thought process"

        So here i am, lay uncomfortable as shit on my side, hands tide behind my back, shivering like a dog on some pointlessly thin mattress..
        just watching my breath dance over a single beam of light peircing through the cold crisp darkness
        ...is this it? is this all i can do to pass the time now?.. well in between dwelling on regrets and berating myself over the last conversations 
        i had with the people i dared let close enough..haha well i hope it was enough because it might defintley be end times .
        It's funny in a stupid shity horrible way, i guess it wouldn't be as funny if it was the first time... but you know what they say
        third times the charm and all that haha guess it's been an odd life so far hahaha but question still remains 
        who did i piss off this time, what did i do and meh is there anything to eat? 
        I'm bloody starving!
